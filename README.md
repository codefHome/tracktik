# Tracktik Challenge - Frontend


âœ¨ The Tracktik Frontend Project is a web application built with React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Redux Toolkit, RTK Query and Material-UI. It serves as the user interface for the challenge. This project is part of my vetting process for Front-end open position. I also write unit test using vitest, RTL and jest to complete the application.
